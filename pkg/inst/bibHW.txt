   abstract = {The past decade has seen substantial research on exact inference for contingency tables, both in terms of developing new analyses and developing efficient algorithms for computations. Coupled with concomitant improvements in computer power, this research has resulted in a greater variety of exact procedures becoming feasible for practical use and a considerable increase in the size of data sets to which the procedures can be applied. For some basic analyses of contingency tables, it is unnecessary to use large-sample approximations to sampling distributions when their adequacy is in doubt. This article surveys the current theoretical and computational developments of exact methods for contingency tables. Primary attention is given to the exact conditional approach, which eliminates nuisance parameters by conditioning on their sufficient statistics. The presentation of various exact inferences is unified by expressing them in terms of parameters and their sufficient statistics in loglinear models. Exact approaches for many inferences are not yet addressed in the literature, particularly for multidimensional contingency tables, and this article also suggests additional research for the next decade that would make exact methods yet more widely applicable.},

While low levels of departure from the null hypothesis are difficult to detect from single-locus data, should such deviation be due to population substructuring, multiple loci, at each of which the number of segregating alleles is large (as seen with hypervariable loci), may easily detect even low levels of departure from HWP. Undetected small levels of departure may still provide conservative estimates of genotype frequencies from allele frequency data, following the current practice in forensic genetics.},

The tests are similar in terms of power.

When all but one allele are rare (frequencies of less than .40 to .15 for n = 10 and 200, respectively) none of the tests are able to detect outbreeding.

(ii) Test of significance (when the obtained level of significance is used as strength against the null hypothesis); here the chi square test and conditional chi square test, both with a continuity correction of 1/4, and the average test were found to be best.},

   abstract = {Exact conditional tests are often required to evaluate statistically whether a sample of diploids comes from a population with Hardy-Weinberg proportions. This requirement is especially common when the sample includes multiple alleles and sparse data, thus rendering asymptotic methods, such as the common {chi}2 test, unreliable. Such an exact test can be performed using the likelihood ratio as its test statistic rather than the more commonly-used probability test. Conceptual advantages in using the likelihood ratio are discussed. A substantially improved algorithm is described to permit the performance of a full-enumeration exact test on sample sizes which are too large for previous methods. An improved Monte Carlo algorithm is also proposed for samples which preclude full enumeration. These algorithms are about two orders of magnitude faster than those currently in use. Finally, methods are derived to compute the number of possible samples with a given set of allele counts, a useful quantity for evaluating the feasibility of the full enumeration procedure. Software implementing these methods, ExactoHW, is provided.},

Because of its importance, much attention has been devoted to tests of Hardy-Weinberg proportions (HWP) over the decades. It has long been recognized that large-sample goodness-of-fit tests can sometimes lead to spurious results when the sample size and/or some genotypic frequencies are small. Although a complete enumeration algorithm for the exact test has been proposed, it is not of practical use for loci with more than a few alleles due to the amount of computation required. We propose two algorithms to estimate the significance level for a test of HWP. The algorithms are easily applicable to loci with multiple alleles. Both are remarkably simple and computationally fast. Relative efficiency and merits of the two algorithms are compared. Guidelines regarding their usage are given. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the practicality of the algorithms.},

   abstract = {A comparison was made of various tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, with emphasis on methods for multiple alleles. For an overall test of deviations from equilibrium, the classical chi-square goodness-of-fit test generally performs well, with continuity corrections needed for extreme gene frequencies or extreme departures from equilibrium. For small samples, probability tests are preferable and for multiple alleles these probability tests may be performed on a sample of all possible sets of genotypic frequencies having a fixed set of sample gene frequencies. Numerical work showed that the continuity-corrected chi-square was the most conservative test procedure, and the uncorrected chi-square the least conservative. With multiple alleles, a better appreciation of the nature of departures from equilibrium is given by the use of disequilibrium coefficients, defined for each heterozygote as the difference between observed and expected frequencies. Likelihood-ratio tests can be used to test each of these coefficients individually but a satisfactory procedure is to divide the squared estimate of each coefficient by its estimated variance and regard the ratio as a single-degree-of-freedom chi-square. Numerical studies confirmed the validity of this approach, which has the great advantage of not requiring solutions of nonlinear equations.},

To avoid computations P(œá), the probability of the square root of a chi-square variable, can be used in the binomial, Poisson and hypergeometric distributions as an approximation to the mid probability. In statistical control of counting experiments or where experiments are being repeated P(œá) rather than P(œá<sub>c</sub>), the probability of œá corrected for continuity, gives acceptable approximations to size of significance levels.

To avoid unreliable large-sample approximations for sparse contingency tables, one can use exact tests like Fisher's classical test that condition on observed marginal totals. Unfortunately, computing p-values for exact tests is often infeasible because of the large number of tables consistent with the marginal totals of an observed table. We develop here Markov chains for sampling from the appropriate conditional distributions for testing genetic equilibrium. These chains compare favorably with a parallel, independent-sampling method that we present. For n haplotype observations on J loci, the Markov chains converge to their stationary distributions in [(J - 1)n ln n]/2 + O(n) steps and can be an efficient tool for estimating p-values. Our theoretical treatment of these results involves strong stationary stopping times, order statistics, large deviations and the embedding of Poisson processes. We include some general results on the application of strong stationary times to bounding the precision and bias of sample average estimators.},

   abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing of Hardy–Weinberg proportions (HWP) with asymptotic goodness-of-fit tests is problematic when the contingency table of observed genotype counts has sparse cells or the sample size is low, and exact procedures are to be preferred. Exact p-values can be (1) calculated via computational demanding enumeration methods or (2) approximated via simulation methods. Our objective was to develop a new algorithm for exact tests of HWP with multiple alleles on the basis of conditional probabilities of genotype arrays, which is faster than existing algorithms. We derived an algorithm for calculating the exact permutation significance value without enumerating all genotype arrays having the same allele counts as the observed one. The algorithm can be used for testing HWP by (1) summation of the conditional probabilities of occurrence of genotype arrays with smaller probability than the observed one, and (2) comparison of the sum with a nominal Type I error rate α. Application to published experimental data from seven maize populations showed that the exact test is computationally feasible and reduces the number of enumerated genotype count matrices about 30% compared with previously published algorithms.},

   abstract = {Much forensic inference based upon DNA evidence is made assuming that the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) is valid for the genetic loci being used. Several statistical tests to detect and measure deviation from HWE have been devised, each having advantages and limitations. The limitations become more obvious when testing for deviation within multiallelic DNA loci is attempted. Here we present an exact test for HWE in the biallelic case, based on the ratio of weighted likelihoods under the null and alternative hypotheses, the Bayes factor. This test does not depend on asymptotic results and minimizes a linear combination of type I and type II errors. By ordering the sample space using the Bayes factor, we also define a significance (evidence) index, P value, using the weighted likelihood under the null hypothesis. We compare it to the conditional exact test for the case of sample size n = 10. Using the idea under the method of {chi}2 partition, the test is used sequentially to test equilibrium in the multiple allele case and then applied to two short tandem repeat loci, using a real Caucasian data bank, showing its usefulness.},

No extra information is obtained from the Tij, where these are departures of numbers of heterozygotes from expectation. Alternatively, the best estimator can be computed from the Tij, ignoring the Tii. Also (1) the variance of the estimate of f equals 1/(N(k - 1)) when all individuals in the sample are unrelated, and the test for f = 0 with 1 d.f. is given by the ratio of the estimate to its standard error; (2) the variance is reduced if some alleles are rare; and (3) if the sample consists of full-sib families of size n, the variance is increased by a proportion (n - 1)/4 but is not increased by a half-sib relationship.--If f is not small, the structure of the population is of critical importance. (1) If the inbreeding is due to a proportion of inbred matings in an otherwise random-breeding population, f as determined from homozygote excess is the same for all genes and expressions are given for its sampling variance. (2) If the homozygote excess is due to population admixture, f is not the same for all genes. The above estimator is probably close to the best for all f values.},

In most genetic applications, the null distribution for a discrete test statistic is approximated with a continuous distribution, but this approximation may not be reasonable. In some cases using the continuous approximation for the expected null distribution may cause truly null test statistics to appear nonnull. We explore the implications of using continuous distributions to approximate the discrete distributions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test statistics and P-values. We derive exact P-value distributions under the null and alternative hypotheses, enabling a more accurate analysis than is possible with continuous approximations. We apply these methods to biological data and find that using continuous distribution theory with exact tests may underestimate the extent of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium in a sample. The implications may be most important for the widespread use of whole-genome case-control association studies and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) testing for data quality control.},

Genetic association studies published in 2002 in Nature Genetics, American Journal of Human Genetics, and American Journal of Medical Genetics were assessed. Data were analyzed on 239 biallelic associations using 154 distinct genotype distribution data sets where HWE could be tested. Any information on HWE was given only for 150 (62.8%) associations (92 (59.7%) data sets). Reanalysis of the data showed significant deviation from HWE in the disease-free controls of 20 associations (13 data sets), but only four of them (two data sets) were admitted in the published articles. Another four deviations (in two data sets) were observed in the combined sample of cases and controls of studies where both cases and controls were diseased, and none were reported in the papers. In all six tested multiallelic associations (six data sets), there was violation of HWE, but this was not admitted in the published articles. Power calculations showed that most studies conforming to HWE simply were largely underpowered to detect HWE deviation; for example, power to detect an inbreeding of magnitude F=0.10 exceeded 80% in only 11 (7%) of the data sets being tested. This empirical evidence suggests that, even in high profile genetics journals, testing and reporting for HWE is often neglected and deviations are rarely admitted in the published reports. Moreover, power is limited for HWE testing in most current genetic association studies.},

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility and applicability of these nine loci in forensic analysis in worldwide populations. The levels of genetic variation measured by number of alleles, allele size variance and heterozygosity are high in all populations irrespective of their effective sizes. Single- as well as multi-locus genotype frequencies are in conformity with the assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Further, alleles across the entire set of nine loci are mutually independent in all populations. Gene diversity analysis shows that pooling of population data by major geographic groupings does not introduce substructure effects beyond the levels recommended by the National Research Council, validating the establishment of population databases based on major geographic and ethnic groupings. A network tree based on genetic distances further supports this assertion, in which populations of common ancestry cluster together. With respect to the power of discrimination and exclusion probabilities, even the relatively reduced levels of genetic variation at these nine STR loci in smaller and isolated populations provide an exclusionary power over 99%. However, in paternity testing with unknown genotype of the mother, the power of exclusion could fall below 80% in some isolated populations, and in such cases use of additional loci supplementing the battery of the nine loci is recommended.},

Two-sided tests have also added to the confusion; it is argued that the best definition of a two-sided probability is twice the observed one-tail probability.},

   abstract = {Associations between allelic frequencies, within and between loci, can be tested for with an exact test. The probability of the set of multi-locus genotypes in a sample, conditional on the allelic counts, is calculated from multinomial theory under the hypothesis of no association. Alleles are then permuted and the conditional probability calculated for the permuted genotypic array. The proportion of arrays no more probable than the original sample provides the significance level for the test. An algorithm is provided for counting genotypes efficiently in the arrays, and the powers of the test presented for various kinds of association. The powers for the case when associations are generated by admixture of several populations suggest that exact tests are capable of detecting levels of association that would affect forensic calculations to a significant extent.},

   abstract = {We describe methods used to provide an exact test of significance of the hypothesis that all factors are mutually independent of each other in 23 and 24 contingency tables. Several numerical examples demonstrate the advantages of exact tests over approximate significance levels. We give bounds on the number of tables needed to perform this exact significance test. In four or more dimensions the number of tables in this enumeration becomes astronomical with even modest sample sizes. Inverting the characteristic function of the exact distribution has proved useful in these situations.},
